# Interactive User Profile Page

## Overview
Build a dynamic web page that displays user information. This project will involve fetching user data (initially mock, later from a simple API), displaying it in an organized manner, and allowing for interactive elements like editing profile details or adding/removing interests. The focus will be on frontend JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and potentially using a lightweight framework or library if time permits. We'll also set up a basic backend using Python (Flask/FastAPI) to serve the user data.
